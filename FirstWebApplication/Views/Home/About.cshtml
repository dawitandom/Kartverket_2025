        <p class="lead hero-sub mb-4">
          We are students of IT & Information Systems. As part of our course work,
          we were assigned to design and develop this website a prototype that demonstrates how
          aviation obstacles can be reported and managed more efficiently.
        </p>

        <div class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 880px;">
          <h3 class="text-success mb-2">Our Mission</h3>
          <p class="text-muted">
            Build a simple, trustworthy flow for reporting obstacles, reviewing submissions,
            and keeping airspace data up to date.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-success mt-4 mb-2">What the System Does</h3>
          <ul class="text-muted text-start d-inline-block">
            <li><strong>Pilots</strong> can report obstacles discovered during flights.</li>
            <li><strong>Entrepreneurs</strong> can register planned projects that may affect aviation.</li>
            <li><strong>Registrars</strong> review and verify the incoming reports.</li>
            <li><strong>Administrators</strong> handle users and system settings.</li>
          </ul>

            This site is a  student prototype created for learning and concept validation.
            It is not an official Kartverket service and should not be used for
            operational reporting.
